Allows you to display a fancy popup (powered as a popover!) to visitors sitewide or per blog, a *very* effective way of advertising a mailing list.

== Description ==

One of the most effective ways to advertise your mailing list, special offer or simply to show ads is via javascript 'pop over' on your site.

And that's exactly what his easy-to-use and guaranteed-to-work plugin does.

Check out the impact it has had on WPMU DEV!

The popover ad, for WPMU DEV running on WPMU.org - which uses this plugin, delivers visitors to WPMU DEV Premium that look atdouble the number of pages and stay doubly as long as visitors that come via Adwords!


You can either use this plugin for all pages on your entire site, by placing it in /mu-plugins/, or allow each individual blog control over it by placing it in /plugins/ - it's easy.

Once you've done that, it's really simple, just activate it and visit Settings > Pop Overs.

Then paste in your ad code... whether its javascript or, like us, an image.

And select it's size, borders, background color, position and even font color.

Then, set the display rules, namely:

Show the Pop Over if one of the following checked rules is true:

Visitor is not logged in.

Visitor has never commented here before.
Visitor did not come from an internal page.
And the visitor has seen the pop over less than  X  times

And you're good to go!

And of course it even contains a link allowing users to click it and never see the popover again... just to take care of the complainers!

Not that we've ever had a single complaint!

Enjoy :)
